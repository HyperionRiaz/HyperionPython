When filling out our application form you indicated that you would like to tutor students.

At Hyperion we have three ranks:
Trial Developer
Associate Developer
Developer

Only Associate Developers and Developers can be paid for working on projects though many do not ask for payment.

To become an Associate Developer you must first be a Trial Developer for a period of two weeks where you are given a project to complete.
After the two week period is up, our Developers vote on whether you should be promoted to Associate Developer or not.

Associate Developers must attend a Skype meeting once every two weeks.

Associate Developers may be promoted to Developers if they show continual commitment to Hyperion. 

== Steps to become a Developer at Hyperion ==

Tasks 1-4 must be completed. 
The form at http://www.rmoola.com/devapp.htm must be completed.
Within two working days of filling out the form you will be contacted and an interview with one of our Developers will be arranged.
If succesful, you will enter into a two week long trial period at Hyperion and given a specific project to work on that fits your skillset.
During this time you will have regular contact with a Developer for assistance and advice.
After the two week period completion of the project is expected. Promotion to Associate Developer will then be decided.
