#This is an example proram.
#The purpose of this program is to demonstrate different operations of different variables.

numOne = 10
numDouble = numOne*numOne #Can use a variable to create new variables.

print numDouble

nameFirst = "Tim"
nameSecond = "Adams"
nameFull = nameFirst + nameSecond #But don't forget a space between the two names, otherwise nameFull just stores "TimAdams"

nameFull = nameFirst + " " + nameSecond #Adding a space inbetween the names

print nameFull

numLong = 10
numDivide = 10/3 

print numDivide #because numDivide is 10 divided by 3, it will have decimal points. 
#Python automatically makes numDivide a long or double datatype so that it can store decimals
