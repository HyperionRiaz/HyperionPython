#This is an additional example file.

#========= Variables ===========
#A variable is a placeholder. 
#We use variables to store data in a program.

num = 2  #Assign the number 2 to the variable 'num'
num = 3  #Now 3 overwrites the 2 that was initially stored in num

#When coding Python, you can use call variables anything you want, but try using descriptive variable names.
myName = "Tom"      # A good variable name
variableOne = "Tom" #Not a good variable name, doesnt give a description of what would be stored inside it

#Variables can store different Data Types.

numTwo = 3 #The variable numTwo stores an interge value
nameTwo = "John" #The variable nameTwo stores and String value
numThree = 0.5 #The variable numthree stores a double, or real numbered, value


#We can outprint the value of variables as follows:

print numTwo 
print nameTwo
print numThree 

#Run this program and take a look at the output. The three lines above generated that output.
#They printed out the VALUES of each variable.

#We can overwrite variables, as shown above:

abc = "A"
abc = "B"  

#A variable always stores the LAST value that was stored in it.
